# DenMune: A Density-Peak Clustering Algorithm

DenMune is a clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary size, shapes, and densities in two-dimensions. Higher dimensions are first reduced to 2D using t-SNE. The algorithm relies on a single parameter K (the number of nearest neighbors). The results show the superiority of the algorithm. Enjoy the simplicity but the power of DenMune.

## When less means more

Most classic clustering algorithms fail to detect complex clusters where clusters are of different sizes, shapes, density, and exist in noisy data. Recently, a density-based algorithm named DenMune showed great ability in detecting complex shapes even in noisy data. it can detect a number of clusters automatically, detect both pre-identified-noise and post-identified-noise automatically, and remove them.

It can achieve an accuracy reach 100% in some classic pattern problems, achieve 97% in the MNIST dataset. A great advantage of this algorithm is being a single-parameter algorithm. All you need is to set a number of k-nearest neighbors and the algorithm will care about the rest. Being Non-sensitive to changes in k, make it robust and stable.

Keep in mind, that the algorithm reduces any N-D dataset to only a 2-D dataset initially, so it is a good benefit of this algorithm is always to plot your data and explore it which makes this algorithm a good candidate for data exploration. Finally, the algorithm comes with a neat package for visualizing data, validating it, and analyzing the whole clustering process.

## How to install DenMune

Simply install DenMune clustering algorithm using pip command from the official Python repository

  [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/denmune.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/denmune/)

  From the shell run the command

  ```shell
pip install denmune
  ```

  From Jupyter notebook cell run the command

  ```ipython3
!pip install denmune
  ```

## How to use DenMune

Once DenMune is installed, you just need to import it

  ```python
from denmune import DenMune
  ```

*<u>Please note that first denmune (the package) in small letters, while the other one(the class itself) has D and M in capital case</u>.*

## Read data

There are four possible cases of data:

  - only train data without labels
  - only labeled train data
  - labeled train data in addition to test data without labels
  - labeled train data in addition to labeled test data

```python
#=============================================
# First scenario: train data without labels
# ============================================ 

data_path = 'datasets/denmune/chameleon/'
dataset = "t7.10k.csv"
data_file = data_path + dataset

# train data without labels  
X_train = pd.read_csv(data_file, sep=',', header=None)  

knn = 39 # k-nearest neighbor, the only parameter required by the algorithm

dm = DenMune(train_data=X_train, k_nearest=knn)
labels, validity = dm.fit_predict(show_analyzer=False, show_noise=True)

```

This is an intuitive dataset which has no groundtruth provided

![t710](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egy1st/images/main/clustering/t710.png)

```python  
#=============================================
# Second scenario: train data with labels
# ============================================

data_path = 'datasets/denmune/shapes/'
dataset = "aggregation.csv" 
data_file = data_path + dataset

# train data with labels
X_train = pd.read_csv(data_file, sep=',', header=None)
y_train = X_train.iloc[:, -1]
X_train = X_train.drop(X_train.columns[-1], axis=1)   

knn = 6 # k-nearest neighbor, the only parameter required by the algorithm

dm = DenMune(train_data=X_train, train_truth= y_train, k_nearest=knn)
labels, validity = dm.fit_predict(show_analyzer=False, show_noise=True)
```

data_path = 'datasets/denmune/pendigits/'
file_2d = data_path + 'pendigits-2d.csv'

## Algorithm's Parameters

1. **Parameters used within the initialization of the DenMune class**

```python  
def __init__ (self,
                  train_data=None, test_data=None, 
                  train_truth=None, test_truth=None,
                  file_2d =None, k_nearest=1, 
                  rgn_tsne=False, prop_step=0,
                  ):
```

- train_data:

  - data used for training the algorithm
  - default: None. It should be provided by the use, otherwise an error will raise.

- train_truth:

  - labels of training data
  - default: None

- test_data:

  - data used for testing the algorithm

- test_truth:

  - labels of testing data
  - default: None

- k_nearest:

  - number of nearest neighbor
  - default: 1. k-nearest neighbor should be at least 1.

- rgn_tsn:

  - when set to True: It will regenerate the reduced 2-D version of the N-D dataset each time the algorithm run.
  - when set to False: It will generate the reduced 2-D version of the N-D dataset first time only, then will reuse the saved exist file
  - default: True

- file_2d: name (include location) of file used save/load the reduced 2-d version

  - if empty: the algorithm will create temporary file named '_temp_2d'
  - default: None

- prop_step:

  - size of increment used in showing the clustering propagation. 
  - leave this parameter set to 0, the default value, unless you are willing intentionally to enter the propagation mode.
  - default: 0


2. **Parameters used within the fit_predict function:**

```python
def fit_predict(self,
                    validate=True, 
                    show_plots=True,
                    show_noise=True,
                    show_analyzer=True
                    ):
```

- validate:
  - validate data on/off according to five measures integrated with DenMune (Accuracy. F1-score, NMI index, AMI index, ARI index)
  - default: True

- show_plots:
  - show/hide plotting of data 
  - default: True

- show_noise:
  - show/hide noise and outlier
  - default: True

- show_analyzer:
  - show/hide the analyzer
  - default: True

## The Analyzer  

The algorithm provide an exploratory tool called analyzer, once called it will provide you with in-depth analysis on how your clustering results perform.

![DenMune Analyzer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egy1st/images/main/clustering/analyzer.png)


## Noise Detection

DenMune detects noise and outlier automatically, no need to any further work from your side.

  - It plots pre-identified noise in black
  - It plots post-identified noise in light grey

You can set show_noise parameter to False. 

```python
# let us show noise  

m = DenMune(train_data=X_train, k_nearest=knn)
labels, validity = dm.fit_predict(show_noise=True)
```

```python
# let us show clean data by removing noise

m = DenMune(train_data=X_train, k_nearest=knn)  
labels, validity = dm.fit_predict(show_noise=False)
```

| noisy data                                                   | clean data                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![noisy data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egy1st/images/main/clustering/noisy_data.png) | ![clean data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egy1st/images/main/clustering/clean_data.png) |



## Validation

You can get your validation results using 3 methods

- by showing the Analyzer
- extract values from the validity returned list from fit_predict function  
- extract values from the Analyzer dictionary
  - There are five validity measures built-in the algorithm, which are:
    - ACC, Accuracy
    - F1 score
    - NMI index (Normalized Mutual Information) 
    - AMI index (Adjusted Mutual Information)
    - ARI index (Adjusted Rand Index)

## K-nearest Evolution

The following chart shows the evolution of pre and post identified noise in correspondence to increase of number of knn. Also, detected number of clusters is analyzed in the same chart in relation with both types of identified noise.

![knn evolution chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egy1st/images/main/clustering/knn_vs_noise.png)

## The Scalability

| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| data size: 5000   | time: 2.3139 seconds   |

## The Stability

The algorithm is only single-parameter, even more it not sensitive to changes in that parameter, k. You may guess that from the following chart yourself. This is of great benefit for you as a data exploration analyst. You can simply explore the dataset using an arbitrary k. Being Non-sensitive to changes in k, make it robust and stable.

![DenMune Stability chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egy1st/images/main/clustering/stability.png)

## Reveal the propagation

One of the top performing features in this algorithm is enabling you to watch how your clusters propagate to construct the final output clusters. Just use the parameter 'prop_step' as in the following example:

```python
dataset = "t7.10k" #  
data_path = 'datasets/denmune/chameleon/'

# train file 
data_file = data_path + dataset +'.csv'  
X_train = pd.read_csv(data_file, sep=',', header=None)


from itertools import chain

# Denmune's Paramaters
knn = 39 # number of k-nearest neighbor, the only parameter required by the algorithm

# create list of differnt snapshots of the propagation
snapshots = chain(range(2,5), range(5,50,10), range(50, 100, 25), range(100,500,100), range(500,2000, 250), range(1000,5500, 500))

from IPython.display import clear_output
for snapshot in snapshots:
    print ("itration", snapshot )
    clear_output(wait=True)  
    dm = DenMune(train_data=X_train, k_nearest=knn, rgn_tsne=False, prop_step=snapshot)
    labels, validity = dm.fit_predict(show_analyzer=False, show_noise=False)   
```

This notebook allows you interact with the algorithm in many aspects:

- you can choose which dataset to cluster (among 4 chameleon datasets)
- you can decide which number of k-nearest neighbor to use
- show noise on/off; thus you can invesetigate noise detected by the algorithm 
- show analyzer on/off


## We love Jupyter Notebooks

Need to test examples one by one, then here other two options

- Use colab offered by google research to test each example individually. 
- If you are a kaggler like me, then Kaggle, the best workspace where data scientist meet, should fit you to test the algorithm with great experience.


Here is a list of Google CoLab & Kaggle notebooks to practice the use of the algorithm interactively.

### Warning: Plagiarized Works

It has come to our attention that the following papers have plagiarized significant portions of the DenMune algorithm and research work:

1. **Paper 1:** "DEDIC: Density Estimation Clustering Method Using Directly Interconnected Cores" published in IEEE Access, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3229582 Authors: Yisen Lin, Xinlun Zhang, Lei Liu, and Huichen Qu, reported at https://pubpeer.com/publications/AFC4E173A4FC0A2AD7E70DE688DDA5
2. **Paper 2:** "Research on stress curve clustering algorithm of Fiber Bragg grating sensor" published in Nature Scientific Reports,  doi: 10.1038/s41598-023-39058-w  Authors: Yisen Lin, Ye Wang, Huichen Qu  & Yiwen Xiong, reported at https://pubpeer.com/publications/7AEF7D0F7505A8B8C130D142522741

We have conducted a thorough analysis and found extensive evidence of plagiarism in these papers, including:

- Verbatim copying of the core algorithm logic and steps from DenMune, with only superficial naming and implementation differences intended to obfuscate the similarity.
- Plagiarized background, related work, and technical details from the original DenMune paper, with minor paraphrasing and without proper attribution.
- Copying of mathematical formulations, concepts, and point classifications from DenMune.
- Reuse of experimental setup, datasets, and compared algorithms from DenMune without justification or acknowledgment.
- Fabricated experimental results, with values directly copied from DenMune's results and falsely claimed as their own.
- Lack of substantive analysis or discussion, further indicating that the experiments were likely not conducted.

Despite our efforts to address these concerns through proper channels, the publishers have decided to allow these plagiarized papers to remain published with only a correction acknowledging the issues, rather than retracting them or mandating a comprehensive correction.

We strongly condemn such academic misconduct and the potential enabling of plagiarism by reputable publishers. Researchers and practitioners should exercise caution when referring to or using the methods described in these plagiarized works.

For the original, properly cited implementation of the DenMune clustering algorithm, please refer to the official repository and resources provided here.

We remain committed to upholding academic integrity and ethical research practices, and we urge the scientific community to take a firm stance against plagiarism and misconduct in scholarly publications.

abstract = {Many clustering algorithms fail when clusters are of arbitrary shapes, of varying densities, or the data classes are unbalanced and close to each other, even in two dimensions. A novel clustering algorithm, “DenMune” is presented to meet this challenge. It is based on identifying dense regions using mutual nearest neighborhoods of size K, where K is the only parameter required from the user, besides obeying the mutual nearest neighbor consistency principle. The algorithm is stable for a wide range of values of K. Moreover, it is able to automatically detect and remove noise from the clustering process as well as detect the target clusters. It produces robust results on various low and high-dimensional datasets relative to several known state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.}
